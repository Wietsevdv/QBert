FIRST BLOCK:
	1st byte: nr of players

	4 bytes for a float. 2 floats for position (x&y)
	So read the next (max 16) bytes as floats (per 4)

SECOND BLOCK:
	this block defines the cube type. Byte size unknown. Write&Read sizeof(CubeType)

	this block defines what cube textures are used for what round.
	first the startTexture then the goalTexture. If CubeType == intermediate the intermediateTexture is last

THIRD BLOCK:
	this block defines how many discs are in each round and where they are located

	1st byte: nr of discs this round

	4 bytes for a float. 2 floats for position (x&y)
	So read the next bytes as floats (per 4) to know the position of every disc
