FIRST BLOCK:
	1st byte: nr of players

	4 bytes for a float. 2 floats for position (x&y)
	So read the next (max 16) bytes as floats (per 4)

SECOND BLOCK:
	this block firstly defines the cube type.

	After that this block defines what cube textures to use for what round and how many discs are in that round and the disc positions.

	The textures will be stored as strings. So read every byte individually until you reach '/0'.
	There are 3 strings to read for every round.

	Next byte after reading the strings is the number of discs in the level
	After that comes the position of each disc. Again 8 bytes for every position.
